# Maze Pathfinding Algorithms

This project implements A* pathfinding algorithm to find the optimal maze path. The path can be modified by adding Spots to create walls and change the structure of the maze, and the button can be clicked to visualize the pathfinding algorithm. Paths that are not pursued are labeled red and the correct path is outlined as green. All the squares will be labeled as either red or green, indicating the positions considered by the character.
