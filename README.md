# Maze Solver Algorithms

This project implements A* and Djikstra's pathfinding algorithms. The path can be modified by adding Spots to create walls in the path, and the button can be clicked to visualize the pathfinding algorithm. Paths that are not pursued are labeled red and the correct path is outlined as green.
